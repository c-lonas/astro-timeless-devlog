## Introduction

Looking for a shiny new tech stack to try out for your next project? This is a fun one. The name is a play on the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/), from which this stack takes some inspiration. Since the T3 stack is modular by nature (as is T2A2) and both the "T's" in this stack are also in T3, it might be fair to think of it is a T3 variation. But I think Next.js is pretty integral to T3, and swapping out the engine changes the character of the stack significantly.

# The Goal

Lightweight | Efficient | Modular | Elegant


## The Stack

# ðŸ”’ [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Typesafe. Just do it.
Astro supports Typescript out of the box, set yourself up for success by using it. Compiler errors are better than runtime errors.

# ðŸš€ [Astro](https://astro.build/)

Astro, a modern frontend framework, is the engine of the stack. Specializes in static site generation by default, but supports dynamic client-side interaction on an as-needed basis through an 'islands' model, loading javascript where (and only where) it is needed.

All the pieces of the stack have well-documented integration with Astro, facilitating a smooth developer experience.

# ðŸŒ€ [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

It's remarkable how many problems Tailwind solves beyond just guiding you towards better styles. Time spent coming up with class names that are rarely re-used, 

# ðŸ—» [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)

Putting aside the fact that the Alpine.js website is blindingly-white and with no dark mode of which I'm aware, a clear sign it's a tool built by sociopaths,
